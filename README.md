# Binary calculator
This is binary calculator that with help of animation explains steps of adding two binary numbers.
The idea is for people to understand binary addition with help of animation.

## Getting started
To start you need to enter two binary numbers and click "Regne ut summen". They don't have to have same number of bits (don't have to be the same length) because leading nulls are added to the number with fewer bits.

## Mente(carry) and Resultat(Result)
Carry shows what we carried from previous addition of bits (1 or 0). If carry has overflow it will be shown in highest bit with 1.
Result is showed without overflow.

## New calculation
To start program again click on "Ny beregning".
